# üí´ About Me:
# Chip 8 Interpreter & Console Project

Welcome to the Chip 8 Interpreter and Console Project repository! This project aims to provide enthusiasts with a comprehensive platform for understanding and developing software and hardware related to the Chip 8 virtual machine.

## Overview

The Chip 8 is a simple, interpreted programming language used in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While originally designed for various RCA COSMAC microcomputers, it has since become a popular target for emulation due to its simplicity and widespread adoption among early home computers and game consoles.

This repository contains:

- **Chip 8 Interpreter**: A fully functional Chip 8 interpreter written in C, utilizing the SDL2 library for graphics and user input handling.
  
- **Chip 8 Console Development**: Plans, resources, and discussions for developing a custom Chip 8 console using microprocessors, aimed at merging low-level circuit design with software development.

## Goals

Our primary goals include:

1. **Interpreter Development**: Continuously enhancing the Chip 8 interpreter to improve compatibility, performance, and features.
  
2. **Console Development**: Collaborating on the design, implementation, and testing of a dedicated Chip 8 console, exploring low-level circuit design and embedded systems.

3. **Learning and Collaboration**: Facilitating learning and collaboration in areas such as Verilog, FPGA design, embedded development using C and C++, and related disciplines.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from enthusiasts of all skill levels! Here are some ways to get involved:

- **Code Contributions**: Help enhance the interpreter, contribute to console design discussions, or work on related projects.
  
- **Documentation**: Improve README files, contribute to project documentation, or write tutorials on Chip 8 development.
  
- **Feedback and Ideas**: Share your thoughts, ideas, or suggestions for the project's direction and goals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chip 8 Interpreter:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  
2. Follow the instructions in the README of the interpreter directory to build and run the interpreter on your system.

## Contact
