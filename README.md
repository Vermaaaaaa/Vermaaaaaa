# üí´ About Me:
Hello there! üëã I'm Rahul Verma, and I'm passionate about low-level software and hardware development. Currently, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of the Chip 8 virtual machine, exploring both software and hardware aspects.

## What I'm Working On

- **Chip 8 Interpreter**: I've been developing a Chip 8 interpreter in C, leveraging the power of SDL2 for graphics and user input handling. It's a project I'm continually refining and expanding upon.

- **Chip 8 Console Project**: Excitingly, I'm also delving into the realm of hardware development. My goal is to create a custom Chip 8 console using microprocessors, combining my interests in low-level circuit design and software development.

## Collaboration Opportunities

I'm always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities, especially in areas like Verilog, FPGA design, and embedded development using C and C++. If you share a passion for these topics or want to explore the Chip 8 further, don't hesitate to reach out!

## How You Can Contribute

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there are many ways to contribute:

- **Code Contributions**: Help enhance the Chip 8 interpreter or join discussions on console design.
  
- **Documentation**: Improve README files, contribute to project documentation, or write tutorials on Chip 8 development.
  
- **Feedback and Ideas**: Share your thoughts, ideas, or suggestions for the project's direction and goals.
