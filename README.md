# About Me:
Hello! I'm Rahul Verma, a student at the University of Leeds, and I'm passionate about low-level software and hardware development. Currently, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of the CHIP-8 virtual machine, exploring both software and hardware aspects.

## What I'm Working On

- **CHIP-8 Interpreter**: I've been developing a Chip 8 interpreter in C, leveraging the power of SDL2 for graphics and user input handling. It's a project I'm continually refining and expanding upon.

- **CHIP-8 Console Project**: Excitingly, I'm also delving into the realm of hardware development. My goal is to create a custom Chip 8 console using microprocessors, combining my interests in low-level circuit design and software development.

- **FPGA Design**: I'm currently diving into FPGA design with Verilog, starting with smaller circuits like adders and multipliers as I explore the exciting world of FPGAs.

## Collaboration Opportunities

I'm always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities, especially in areas like Verilog, FPGA design, and embedded/low level development using C and C++. If you share a passion for these topics or want to explore the CHIP-8 further, don't hesitate to reach out!
